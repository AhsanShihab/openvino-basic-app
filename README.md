I have written a blog series introducing intel openVINO toolkit to deploy AI at the edge. This repository contains the example codes used in the posts.

# Run the app
If you have OpenVINO and other pre0requisites installed, open command prompt and run the following command (if installed in default directory, otherwise use the appropriate directory,

```bash
"C:\Program Files (x86)\IntelSWTools\openvino\bin\setupvars.bat"
```

Clone the repository
````bash
git clone https://github.com/AhsanShihab/openvino-basic-app.git
````

Change directory to the openvin-basic-app folder
````bash
cd openvino-basic-app
````

Run the app file
````bash
python app.py
````
